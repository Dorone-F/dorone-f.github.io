                    <h2>General Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to this internship and the missions that were offered to me, I was able to acquire a lot of
                        social skills that will be of great use to me in the rest of my studies.<br/>
                        Regarding my goals, this internship allowed me to evolve, grow and learn more
                        about myself, I feel less shy than before.<br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This internship also taught me that repetitive tasks are not the most suitable for me and
                        that from a social point of view, we do not choose our work colleagues, which is why we must
                        learn to accept others to achieve given goals
                    </p>
