                <h4>Presentation:</h4>
                <p>
                    Hello,
                </p>

                <p> 
                    My name is Dorone Feingold, I'm 20, I'm studying in the 3rd year of engineering school at ECE Paris school. 
                    After having graduated from a technological baccalaureate STI2D (science and technology of industry and sustainable development) with honors,
                    I decided to move towards a career as an engineer to be able to get closer to my dream job which is to work in the field of technology and medicine.
                </p>
                <h4>Study:</h4>
                <p>
                    For this I had to pass an oral competition for entry into an engineering school which offers this major during the engineering school years.
                    During the first two years of integrated preparation, I acquired all the scientific bases
                    and techniques to successfully complete the engineering cycle.
                    So many opportunities to fully understand how a team works,
                    discover my favorite subjects, meet professional speakers and engineers
                    and identify the course targeted in the engineering cycle.
                </p>
                <h4>Actually:</h4>
                <p>
                    I am currently in an international semester in Wales for the entire 2nd semester
                    of the 1st year of engineering school.
                </p>

                    <h4>Sport:</h4>
                    <p>
                        I am passionate about sports including French boxing, basketball, running and bodyweight training.
                        Sport is a real way for me to take my mind off things,
                        I usually do 4 bodyweight sessions per week, 
                        3 hours of basketball basketball on Saturday morning and when the weather is nice I try to add the race.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The fact of doing so much sport allows me to put into perspective the work I have to do,
                        it allows me to improve my concentration during the lessons and allowed me to acquire a 
                        significant rigor which will be very useful to me as that future engineer.

                    <h4>Hobbies:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Regarding my other hobbies, I love series like Game of Throne or historical series like "Vikings" or "Marco Polo" which
                        for the most part give just elements of history,
                        and which subsequently makes me want to do more advanced research on the period in question.<br/>
                        But I am particularly a fan of Japanese animation or more generally of the Japanese universe. <br/>
                        I find that it is a universe that allows us to escape, to relax and at the same time to reflect on what surrounds us. <br/>

                    <h4>Next:</h4>
                    <p>
                        First I have to find an internship for the end of my 1st year of engineering school,
                        a minimum 5-week internship in business discovery. <br/>
                        Then enter the Health and Technology major for the rest of my engineering cycle and discover everything
                        the secrets of this major, acquire as much knowledge as possible during my last years of study
                        and why not pursue a doctorate and
                        finally, do my end-of-study internship abroad and then leave France to go and work abroad.
