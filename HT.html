                    <h2>Presentation of the Major</h2>
                    <p>
                        
                        The Health and Technology Major aims to present the applications of engineering training in trades directly or indirectly related to health. <br/>
                        It provides medical knowledge and the vocabulary necessary for communication between the engineer and the healthcare professional. <br/>
                        It helps to understand the complexity of national and international health systems, both in terms of the payment of health costs and the exchange of information,
                        regulations, security and standards applicable to information systems as well as to connected objects which invade the daily lives of patients and will play a major role in their monitoring tomorrow. <br/>
                        Habits are changing and engineers are at the heart of the technological revolution. <br/>
                        It is up to them to understand the issues and define what will be the health of tomorrow.

                    <h2>Why this Major ?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Since I've been in high school I've been a big fan of technology 
                        and more specifically, the one that affects the medical sector<br/>
                        This field, which has been exponentially evolving for years, simply makes life better for human beings<br/>
                        I think it's wonderful to see science evolving in such a sector as health, for example, the simple act of being able to give back 
                        The sight of all colors to a colorblind person this simple do is simply amazing, <br/>
                        When I learned that the engineering school ECE Paris had this major, I put all my doubts to rate and I did not hesitate to send
                        a request for an application, <br/>
                        Knowing that my goal this is getting closer day by day makes me die of impatience haha, know that in less than a year now I will finally
                        to be able to learn concepts that will be essential for my future job fills me with happiness and joy regarding the rest of my career.<br/><br/>
    
                        To learn a little more about why I have such a keen interest in this major, we must go back a little in time more exactly on October 06, 2009:<br/><br/>
    
                        On Tuesday, October 6, 2009 was a day my most normal faith, my parents were going as usual to buy meat in their first life.<br/>
                        When leaving the store, my father opened the trunk of the car to store the groceries that he and my mother had just bought and that's when the drama began.<br/><br/>
                        When my mother put all the shopping in the trunk a car backed up on her making her a good pavement where she was on the opposite pavement, on the ground no longer moving and began to turn blue 
                        My father depcha to call an ambulance during this time the car that caused this accident to simply fled his responsibility and fled.<br/>
                        The ambulance took my mother to the hospital where she will remain in a coma for 48 hours because of the shock that caused her a head injury that to him
                        even caused a brain hemorrhage. <br/>
                        At her wake the doctors told her that she had a fracture of the left occipital lobe and basic olfactory nerve sectioning that she would have for life 
                        loss of taste and smell was followed by dizziness and endless nausea.<br/>
                        This day that at first glance seemed normal, it turned into a cauchmardesque day that one would not even wish this to his worst enemy.<br/><br/>
    
                        The years passed, the appointments with the specialists also and nothing helps, no solutions were found we are on February 12, 2021 it's soon
                        12 years that are calvere hard, this life comparable to hell where every minute, every second is a fight against life in which defeat is not an option.<br/><br/>
    
                        This event was a lot of declique for me and give me a goal that is to find a solution so that my mother can also have a better life, a life 
                        or the pleasure of eating, the pleasure of feeling or the pleasure of not hurting anywhere will be possible. <br>
    
                        All its reasons make that the major health and technology is my major predilection.<br/><br/><br/>
