                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Mallet Foundation was created after the Second World War to help children who were unwittingly victims of the fighting.
                        It was created in 1947 by Baroness Mallet, a strong personality committed to the resistance and the actions of the French Red Cross, of which she was vice-president.<br>
                        She then received war mutilated children to look after them and prepare them for professional life, at the Château des Mesnuls near Montfort’Amaury (Yvelines).
                       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, a functional rehabilitation center and a training center for physiotherapists were created in Bois Larris (La Morlaye - Oise) and a motor education institute in Villepatour (Seine-et-Marne). 
                        In 1978, the Foundation redeployed its activities and moved to Richebourg.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Mallet Foundation, recognized as a public utility since 1948, has the mission of helping people with disabilities to integrate into social life.
                        It welcomes people of all ages, in four separate establishments: the Motor Education Institute, the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Center, the Medical Reception Center, and the Les Petits Pas micro-crèche.

                    <h2>My Tasks</h2>
    
                    <p>
                        The tasks carried out during this internship was a big opportuntity for me to improved my knowledge in the health and Technology field. 
                        Indeed, I was able to carry out my internship in the field of health while bringing my knowledge and vision of a future engineer.<br>
                        The freedom i had allowed me to develop my knowledge in health and at the same time my engineering skills
                        but also I was able to improve my work independently through the various research that I was able to carry out.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Reminder of missions:</strong></p>
                    
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify the role and skills of the occupational therapist within a rehabilitation center</li>
                        <li>Understand occupational therapy support for patients with neurological disabilities</li>
                        <li>Support the recommendation and implementation of new technologies to facilitate the daily lives of patients</li>
                        <li>Identify the benefits of an occupational therapist/engineer collaboration</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I took care of a total of <strong>6 patients</strong> each with a different pathology ranging from memory disorders (suspected Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome) to stroke to even head trauma.<br>
                        In 5 weeks I had to first learn and understand the medical vocabulary used in the service (mainly vocabulary related to stroke) to be able to then propose and try to find
                        and realize technological solutions for the patients.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        The solutions are so vast and important that I would not have enough time to really go into the details but if you are interested do not hesitate to contact me by email.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to this internship and the missions that were offered to me, I was able to acquire a lot of
                        skills and knowledge and for the first time a first entrance in the health and technology field which will be very usefull for the end of my studies.<br/>
                        I was able to learn that the success of taking care of a patient does not only depend on the solution provided but also on its follow-up.<br>
                        Solutions may not be successful for various reasons (lack of time, money, administrative delays) but good patient care will always be more appreciated than a good technological solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This internship completely confirmed my choice of study for the years to come in engineering school by the possibility of innovating or by the real usefulness of it, which is a direct and beneficial application on the lives of people who have lost a particular limb or neurological capacity.
                        I understand that the financial aspect is the most important thing to take into account.<br>
                        However, I do not subscribe to this view at all because it directly impacts the future life of a disabled patient which seem offbeat for me.
                    </p>
                        
                   
                    <p>
                        The freedom I had during this internship allowed me to flourish in an exciting and motivating field.<br>
                        In addition, it is important to have a first experience in the field to become fully aware of the issue in which we are getting into.
